Lengthy download times could turn users off before they even experience your mobile app. Plus, each user's device has a finite amount of disk space. For price, some users expect their apps to be free or inexpensive. These problems compound if the developing world is part of your target market; especially due to internet speeds, earning power and exchange rates.</p>\n","<p>How can we effectively come up with strategies to size and price our app?</p>\n","<ul>\n","<li>Does the size of an app affect its rating? </li>\n","<li>Do users really care about system-heavy apps or do they prefer light-weighted apps? </li>\n","<li>Does the price of an app affect its rating? </li>\n","<li>Do users always prefer free apps over paid apps?</li>\n","</ul>\n","<p>We find that the majority of top rated apps (rating over 4) range from 2 MB to 20 MB.

Sentiment analysis of user reviews\n","<p>Mining user review data to determine how people feel about your product, brand, or service can be done using a technique called sentiment analysis. User reviews for apps can be analyzed to identify if the mood is positive, negative or neutral about that app. For example, positive words in an app review might include words such as 'amazing', 'friendly', 'good', 'great', and 'love'. Negative words might be words like 'malware', 'hate', 'problem', 'refund', and 'incompetent'.</p>\n","<p>By plotting sentiment polarity scores of user reviews for paid and free apps, we observe that free apps receive a lot of harsh comments, as indicated by the outliers on the negative y-axis.

The median polarity score for paid apps is a little higher than free apps, thereby syncing with our previous observation.</p>\n","<p>In this notebook, we analyzed over ten thousand apps from the Google Play Store.
